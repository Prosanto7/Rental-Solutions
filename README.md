## Stakeholders & Features

### Features for Non-Registered Users:
Non-registered users have limited access to the CMS. They can view approved posts and search for posts based on tags, categories, or keywords. The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both small and large devices. Pagination is implemented to enhance user experience, enabling users to navigate through multiple posts easily.

### Features for Registered Users:
Registered users have more privileges within the CMS. They can create, update, and delete their own posts. Additionally, registered users can create and delete comments on posts. To enhance social media integration, registered users can share posts on Facebook. The user interface includes forms and controls for creating and managing posts and comments. AJAX and jQuery are utilized for most of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to prevent webpage reloading, ensuring a smoother and more efficient user experience.

### Features for Administrators:
Administrators have the highest level of access and control within the CMS. They can approve or reject pending posts, allowing them to moderate the content on the platform. Additionally, administrators have the ability to delete posts, providing an extra layer of content management. The CMS also enables administrators to create and delete categories and tags, allowing for efficient organization and categorization of posts. The admin interface includes dedicated sections for managing pending posts.

### Security Measures:
The CMS incorporates various security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities. Sessions are used to validate user roles, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain functionalities. Basic PHP and JavaScript methods are implemented to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks, enhancing the overall security of the system. Additionally, a basic RewriteRule is included to implement pretty URLs, making the URLs more user-friendly.

### Dark and Light Mode:
As a demonstration of front-end development skills, the admin interface of the CMS includes a dark and light mode. Users can switch between the two modes based on their preferences. This feature is implemented using raw CSS and JavaScript, providing an aesthetically pleasing and customizable user experience.
